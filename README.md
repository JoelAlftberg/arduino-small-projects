# arduino-small-projects
Some small Arduino projects playing with LEDs and potentiometers.

## TODO

- [ ] Add videos of projects
- [ ] Add circuit diagrams
- [ ] Actually comment the code

## Button-LED
My first try at making something with the Arduino.\
A very simple program which makes the LED light up if you press the button.

## Potentio-LED
Three LEDs and one potentiometer.\
Turning the potentiometer turns on the LEDs in order, and finally makes them blink.

## Safecracking game!
Two potentiometers, simulating a safe with two knobs.\
Making it a bit easier to crack the code by giving the player\
hints with LEDs.
